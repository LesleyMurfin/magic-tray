# Script Index - Magic Mouse + Apple Keyboard Battery Monitor

Last updated: 2026-05-18 Calgary time

## Overview

Magic Mouse Tray and Apple Keyboard Windows battery monitor accumulates script artifacts across three primary locations over 3 weeks of RCA/diagnosis work. This index consolidates:

1. **Canonical (refactored)** keyboard probe suite - reusable, parameterized, production-ready
2. **Session probe scripts** - dated May 7-8 RCA probes, now renamed to clean undated names
3. **Keyboard Battery (PATH-C)** - canonical kbd-*.ps1 + postpatch-*.ps1 from mm3-driver
4. **Mouse PATH-A** scripts for install/test pipeline
5. **Keyboard kernel filter** driver build/sign/install scripts
6. **Task runner** phases orchestrating the full driver lifecycle

---

## Canonical - Use These

### Refactored Keyboard Probe Suite
Location: `/home/lesley/projects/Personal/magic-mouse-tray/scripts/refactored/`

All scripts here:
- Accept `-OutputDir` (defaults `C:\mm-dev-queue\kbd-runs`) and `-Label` parameters
- Create unique run directories per invocation: `<yyyyMMdd-HHmmss>-<Label>`
- Generate `manifest.json` with run metadata + `stdout.txt` tee
- Have full comment-based help: `Get-Help <script> -Full`
- Use ASCII hyphens only (no em-dashes)
- Reference canonical test fixture defaults from `Get-KbdDefaults` helper

## Action Items

1. **Runner path updates** (medium priority)
   - mm-task-runner.ps1:1439 references `/mnt/d/mm3-driver/scripts/postpatch-quick-smoke.ps1` (hardcoded)
   - Update to call `scripts/postpatch-quick-smoke.ps1` from repo OR keep D: path (both exist now)
   - Same for kbd-filter-evidence.ps1:1536 and other mm3-driver paths

2. **Session probe cleanup** (low priority)
   - 25 renamed session probes in `scripts/` have canonical replacements in `scripts/refactored/`
   - Can be deleted after full Track 6 regression test passes

3. **Windows-side scripts dir**
   - No canonical `/mnt/c/Users/Lesley/scripts/` yet (mentioned in user feedback)
   - Consider populating once refactored set stabilizes

## Activity Log

| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| 2026-05-09 | Created canonical SCRIPT-INDEX.md: audited 63 scripts across 6 locations (refactored, dated, mouse PATH-A, keyboard driver, runner, ETW). Consolidated cross-references, identified 23 throwaway candidates, flagged runner hardcoded paths for update. Index extends refactored/README.md with full landscape view. |
| 2026-05-18 | Synced 17 canonical kbd-*.ps1 + postpatch-*.ps1 + mse-dump-v3-sdp.ps1 from D:\mm3-driver\scripts\ into scripts/. Renamed 25 session probe scripts: stripped date suffixes (2026-05-07/08), no content edits. Added Keyboard Battery (PATH-C) section. Updated runner cross-reference status. PRD-185 / branch ai/magic-mouse-complete-fix. |
| 2026-05-18 | Track 0: added STARTUP-REPAIR phase to mm-task-runner.ps1; extracted scripts/build-driver.ps1, scripts/sign-driver.ps1, scripts/install-driver.ps1 as standalone M13 build/sign/install scripts. PRD-200 Phase B / branch ai/mm-t0-scripts. Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com> |

# Incident 2026-09-16 — Magic Mouse v3 (PID 0323): battery read 0 %, then scroll died

**Status: both restored on hardware.** Battery `pct=18 %` from a live `GetInputReport(0x90)`
(`bytes=90-04-12-00-…`), scroll confirmed working by the user, live driver
sha256 `4c90468c386229b6f5c813da012e26fc888ad2e3a01ae424f62e852af07ad723`
(the 17:45:34 build `08E91E37` plus its new Authenticode signature), published as `oem16.inf`.

Two independent defects, both in the KMDF lower filter, both shipped in the 01:44 build.
Neither was "a driver swap broke it", which is what the first two passes at this claimed.

---

## Defect 1 — battery: 1-byte control-channel read diverted into the ACL scratch

`Driver.c:371` (live build's source, `C:\mm-dev-queue\kmdf-204-bld-2043\Driver.c`):

```c
if (sdpOk && pBrb->BrbL2caAclTransfer.BufferSize > 0 &&
    pBrb->BrbL2caAclTransfer.BufferSize < MM_ACL_MAX_PARSE)
```

HidBth reads the HID **control** channel header-first: the first transfer asks for exactly
**1 byte**, the `0xA1` HID DATA prefix. `1 > 0` matched, so the filter swapped the caller's 1-byte
buffer for its 78-byte `reqCtx->Scratch`, set `BufferSize = MM_ACL_MAX_PARSE`, ORed
`ACL_SHORT_TRANSFER_OK`, and the transport handed back the **entire**
`GET_REPORT(Input, 0x90)` response into the scratch. On completion `OnAclTransferComplete` could
only copy back `pass = min(received, origCap)` = 1 byte (`Driver.c:535-545`), and translation was
skipped because `origCap < MM_MOUSE_REPORT_LEN` (`Driver.c:507`). HIDCLASS pre-zeroes the caller
buffer and writes the report id into byte 0 → `90 00 00` with `STATUS_SUCCESS`, at every layer.

Measured, read-only, on the broken binary:

| counter | value |
| --- | --- |
| `LastAclBytes` | `A1-90-04-16` → `0x16` = **22 %**, on the wire |
| `LastAclReceived` | 4 |
| `LastAclCapacity` | **1** |
| `LastOutHdr` / `LastOutBufferSize` | `0x41` (GET_REPORT/Input) / 2 |
| `AclInterceptCount` / `AclTranslateCount` | +153 / +148 over 5 probes → 5 untranslated INs |

`LastAclCapacity = 1` with 4 bytes received is the whole bug in one number.

### It was latent, not new

The gate is old — present in `be5a28e` and `fa0abe7`. It is masked whenever
`ctx->MtControlHandle` is armed, because the pass-through at `Driver.c:343-348` then routes
control-channel traffic around the gate. Arming happens **only** on a host-initiated
`BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL` with `Psm == MM_HID_CONTROL_PSM` (`Driver.c:619-624`);
`BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL_RESPONSE`, which is how a device-initiated Apple reconnect arrives, is never
handled. Filed as **#40**.

### Why the "the 01:10 driver swap broke it" story is wrong

PE section headers of the four builds parked in `kmdf-204-bld-2043`, parsed from the files:

| build | PE TimeDateStamp (UTC) | `.text` vsize | `.pdata` | functions | `INIT` | `.rdata` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `08E91E37` 17:45 healthy | 2026-09-15 23:45:34 | 16423 | 492 | **41** | 752 | 3456 |
| `CB2E2EB9` 01:07 first bad | 2026-09-16 07:07:48 | 16487 | 492 | **41** | 752 | 3456 |
| `214222B7` 01:32 | 2026-09-16 07:32:55 | 16871 | 528 | **44** | 828 | 3504 |
| `25A3287A` 01:44 installed | 2026-09-16 07:44:18 | 16871 | 528 | **44** | 828 | 3504 |

`.pdata` is one 12-byte `RUNTIME_FUNCTION` per function: 41 functions in the healthy build **and**
in the first-bad build, 44 in the 01:32+ builds. `c3aff5d`'s channel-invalidation change adds
exactly three functions (`MmInvalidateClosedChannelStateLocked`, `OnCloseChannelComplete`,
`EvtDeviceContextCleanup`), so it exists only in the 01:32 and 01:44 builds. The binary installed
at 01:10:51, under which the battery zeroed 18 seconds later, has 64 bytes of `.text` delta from
the healthy build and **zero new functions**.

`C:\Windows\INF\setupapi.dev.log`, sections 18:13:50.039 and 01:10:51.156 — byte-identical commands:

```
cmd: "C:\WINDOWS\system32\pnputil.exe" /add-driver C:\mm-dev-queue\kmdf-204-sign-2043\MagicMouseDriver-kmdf-204-scroll.inf /install
```

That staging directory is overwritten in place, which is how one path delivered two binaries.

Tray log, `%APPDATA%\MagicMouseTray\debug.log`:

| time | line |
| --- | --- |
| 2026-09-15 18:09:28 | `MOUSE_BATTERY_ZERO … [90 00 00]` — on the *previous* driver |
| 2026-09-15 18:10:56 | `MOUSE_BATTERY_ZERO … [90 00 00]` |
| 2026-09-15 18:16:27 | `MOUSE_BATTERY_OK … pct=35 % (Input 0x90 COL02)` — after the 18:13 install |
| 2026-09-16 00:09:49 | `MOUSE_BATTERY_OK … pct=28 %` — 106 good reads, across 60- and 45-minute idle gaps |
| 2026-09-16 01:11:09 | `MOUSE_BATTERY_ZERO … [90 00 00]` — after the 01:10 install, and for 22 hours after |

The battery was **already zero before** the healthy install, and that install *fixed* it. So
zero/non-zero tracks the arming state, not the binary. `[INFERENCE]` the 18:13-worked /
01:10-failed difference is who initiated the reconnect — host vs device — not the 64-byte delta.
`c3aff5d` is in the currently-broken binary and makes the unarmed state permanent by re-NULLing the
handle on every close; it did not cause the 01:11 zero.

## Defect 2 — scroll: notches emitted only for the lowest-id contact

`GestureEngine.c` mtime **2026-09-16 01:12:47** — after the healthy 17:45 build *and* after the
01:07 build. This logic ships only in the 01:32 and 01:44 binaries.

```c
ULONG refId = MM_TOUCH_SLOTS;                                            // :95
... if (st == TOUCH_STATE_DRAG && ctx->TouchAnchorValid[id] && id < refId)
        refId = id;                                                      // :107-110
...
if (stepY >= (INT)step || stepY <= -(INT)step) {
    if (id == refId) { *outWheel += (stepY > 0) ? 1 : -1; }               // :168
    ctx->TouchAnchorY[id] = (INT16)y;                                     // :169  re-anchors anyway
}
```

Only the **lowest-numbered** dragging contact can emit. Every other finger is still re-anchored at
`:169`/`:174`, so its travel is discarded. A resting finger, thumb or palm edge holding a low slot
id becomes the reference, never moves, and nothing is ever emitted.

### Hardware proof (Raw Input sink, `RIDEV_INPUTSINK`, non-elevated)

Window 23:36:18-23:37:05, 15 active seconds, on the 01:44 binary:

| measured | value |
| --- | --- |
| `Rid12Count` / `AclTranslateCount` / `AclInterceptCount` | **+694 / +694 / +694** |
| wheel events delivered to Windows | **0** |
| hwheel events delivered | **0** |
| raw mouse records, same device, same window | 457, `sum |dx|+|dy|` = 12485 |
| device | `\\?\HID#…_VID&0001004c_PID&0323&Col01`, `hDevice 0x5251099`, sole contributor |

694 multitouch reports in, 0 notches out, while pointer motion from the *same* HID collection
arrived normally. An earlier window was correctly voided rather than reported as a negative
(`Rid12Count` +0 — nobody was touching the mouse).

### Host model (both rules, replayed; `/tmp/gesture_model.py`)

Notches per 60 touch units, `ScrollStep = 8` (the effective value, published at `Diag!ScrollStep`):

| gesture | live 01:12 rule | previous per-finger rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| two fingers moving together | 7 | 14 |
| **low-id finger resting, other scrolls** | **0** | 7 |
| **low-id finger drifting 1 u / 8 reports** | **0** | 7 |
| **three contacts, lowest resting** | **0** | 14 |
| **same as row 2 on the X axis (AC Pan)** | **0** | 7 |
| low-id finger 6× slower than the other | 1 | 8 |
| pinch, fingers opposing | **+7 (invented scroll)** | 0 (cancels) |

Not tunable away: a stationary reference finger has `stepY == 0` at `:159`, so the dead cases stay
at 0 notches for every legal `ScrollStep` (1…224, `GestureEngine.h:48-49`). The pinch row is a
second, opposite regression — the new rule fabricates scroll where the old one cancelled.

Constants verified: `MM_SCROLL_STEP` 8 (`GestureEngine.h:42`), `MIN` 1 / `MAX` 224 (`:48-49`),
`MM_TOUCH_SLOTS` 16 (`Driver.h:65`), `TOUCH_STATE_MASK` `0xF0`, `START` `0x30`, `DRAG` `0x40`
(`GestureEngine.c:10-12`). The `refId` pre-pass id/state extraction (`:103`, `:106`) is identical
to the main loop's (`:119`, `:128`) — so this is not an id-mismatch bug, it is the rule itself.

## What was done

1. Staged the last binary observed reading a real percentage —
   `kmdf-204-bld-2043\MagicMouseDriver-kmdf-2.0.4-scroll-08E91E37.sys`, 25600 bytes,
   sha256 `08e91e37af3b…cababd6ac` (**note:** an earlier hand-off quoted this prefix wrong in two
   nibble groups) — into `C:\mm-dev-queue\kmdf-204-sign-2043-restore-08E91E37\`, with
   `STAGE-MANIFEST.txt`, `RESTORE.ps1` and `RESTORE-README.md`. `kmdf-204-sign*` untouched.
2. Elevated execution came from the existing **`MM-Dev-Cycle`** scheduled task (RunLevel Highest)
   via its `RUN|<nonce>|<script-path>` route — `request.txt` + `schtasks /run /tn MM-Dev-Cycle`,
   result in `result.txt`, transcript in `run-<nonce>.log`. `Start-Process -Verb RunAs` is not
   usable from this session: the UAC consent came back
   `InvalidOperationException :: The operation was canceled by the user`.
3. First queued run aborted in step B on a **bug in `RESTORE.ps1` itself**: its `Run` helper did
   `& $exe @cmdArgs` and then `return $LASTEXITCODE`, so the function returned the tool's entire
   transcript *with* the exit code appended, and `-ne 0` compared an array. Inf2Cat had actually
   succeeded (`Errors: None`, `Catalog generation complete`, exit 0). Fixed by piping native output
   to the host (`| ForEach-Object { Say $_ }`) so only the code is returned.
4. Second run: Inf2Cat → `signtool sign` + `verify /pa` on `.sys` and `.cat` (both
   `Successfully verified`) → `pnputil /delete-driver oem50.inf /uninstall /force` (exit 0) →
   `pnputil /add-driver … /install` (exit 0, published as **`oem16.inf`**) →
   `pnputil /restart-device` on the 0323 HID instance (exit 0).
5. The script reported "battery not confirmed" because it read the tray log immediately, while the
   device was still re-enumerating (`POLL_DEVICE_TIMEOUT`, `MOUSE_RID90_FAILED err=21` at
   23:37:42). A direct probe afterwards returned `GetInputReport0x90=True bytes=90-04-12-00-… pct=18`.

Prerequisites measured before any of it: cert `16940C0F…` = `CN=MagicMouseFix` in LocalMachine
My + Root + TrustedPublisher, `HasPrivateKey=True`, expiry 2036-05-02; `TESTSIGNING` on
(`SystemStartOptions`); HVCI `Enabled=0`, `SecurityServicesRunning={0}`; `Inf2Cat` x86-only at
`wdk-packages\…WDK.x64.10.0.26100.6584\c\bin\10.0.26100.0\x86\`; `signtool` x64 at
`…SDK.CPP.10.0.26100.6584\c\bin\10.0.26100.0\x64\`; no EWDK mounted (`F:\` does not exist).

## Current state

| live driver | `4c90468c386229b6f5c813da012e26fc888ad2e3a01ae424f62e852af07ad723` = `08E91E37` + signature |
| published as | `oem16.inf` (was `oem50.inf`) |
| battery | **18 %**, live `GetInputReport(0x90)` → `90-04-12-00-…` |
| scroll | working (user-confirmed); this binary predates the 01:12 rule |
| DriverVer | still `09/15/2026,2.0.4.3` |

**This is a reprieve, not a fix.** The restored binary still contains the latent `:371` defect; it
survives idle gaps only because it lacks the clear-on-close that `c3aff5d` added. Its scroll is the
per-finger rule — roughly twice as many notches per unit of travel, i.e. the "too sensitive"
behaviour reported before 09-15.

## Open work

| item | state |
| --- | --- |
| **#39** — `BufferSize >= MM_MOUSE_REPORT_LEN`, the deterministic battery fix | pushed, `8eaebe1`; also carries the 2.0.4.4 bump, #38's `RemainingBufferSize` restore, and a source-contract gate. **Never compiled** — no WDK compiler payload on this host |
| **#38** — `RemainingBufferSize` never restored | fixed in `32baa82` on that branch |
| **#40** — `MtControlHandle` never armed on device-initiated reconnect, cleared on every close | filed, not fixed |
| scroll regression | issue + minimal fix in progress: delete the `refId` pre-pass (`:82-111`) and the two `if (id == refId)` wrappers (`:168`, `:173`), and raise the detent to 16 so sensitivity halves without any gesture going dead. Max-delta and per-report-cap alternatives both measure 15 notches on skewed-speed drags vs 7 |
| 2.0.4.4 build | blocked on a Windows host with the EWDK/WDK compiler |

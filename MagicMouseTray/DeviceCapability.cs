// Pure function of (Kind, last battery sentinel, driver status) — no I/O.
// Read paths are deterministic per DeviceKind; the last reading distinguishes
// "working" (>=0) from "present but blocked" (-2) from "not readable/absent" (-1).
//
// CAVEAT (RULE #1): DriverStatus from DriverHealthChecker.GetStatus() is a single
// GLOBAL worst-state-wins value (DriverHealthChecker.cs:114-126), not per-device.
// With multiple Apple mice paired, one device's worst state colors every mouse row.
// Acceptable as a heuristic. The scroll filter governs SCROLL, not the v1/v2 split
// battery read, so a non-Ok driver does NOT mean the v1/v2 battery is unreadable —
// the action below is a scroll-fix, not a battery-fix.
